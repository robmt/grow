# Quick Start Guide

---

**aka idk man just tell me what to do.**

## Placement

Considerations when selecting the location for growing.

- Relatively stable room temperature.
  - Avoid a cold area if possible. If not possible warming mats will help.
- Fans can be loud. Place the setup in an area where you won't be bothered by the noise.
- Errant lights are bad for photos, if possible isolate it almost like a darkroom. Sure the zipper is great on the tent but adding a door is even better.
- Tents aren't cute. Enough said.

## Materials to start

- Tent

- Elastic Netting
- Ph Meter or Test Drops
- Ph Up / Down

### Buy a tent

Nearly any tent will do but for growing two plants go for a 2' by 4' tent. No need to spend tons of money on this, just check reviews and makes ure that it has a good zipper and a few other entry points for wires and ducts

### Get your lights

Many tents will come with lights. Honestly i dont know much about lights but they need to be pretty intense with uniform coverage. Something like the Spider Farmer SF-2000.

Most of the time the light that comes in the kit will be good enough for a first grow. **Make sure you have a decent timer to keep the right light schedule later on**

### Get your filter and blower

Again, most of the time this comes with the tent kit.

Though not strictly necessary, definitely extremely helpful. Otherwise your whole house will stay dank during the last part of the grow.

### Get your soil and pots

Seems like the consensus here is to use [coco coir](https://www.epicgardening.com/coconut-coir/) for your medium to grow in. We recommend the [fox farms coco](https://foxfarm.com/product/seventy-thirty-growing-media)

For the pot, doesn't really matter. Cheap [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Gardzen-10-Pack-Gallons-Aeration-Handles/dp/B076FLM4T2/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1QRCITDSL954P&keywords=fabric%2Bpot&qid=1700016096&sprefix=fabric%2Bpot%2Caps%2C119&sr=8-8&th=1) fabric ones work fine.

### Get the Nutrients

Nutrients are super important for grows, **required** for grows in coco.

### Get the seeds

Seeds don't always take, plan to start more than you need to harvest. If you end up with too many for the tent to hold then the rooted plant will make a great gift.

#### Auto

Seeds that automatically move between cycles. These are faster to harvest.

#### Photo

Seeds that use light cycles to move between stages. These can get bigger, take longer, and anecdotally are more forgiving.

### Nice to haves

A **small fan** to blow over plants. This can help to strengthen the stalk and stems for later larger growther.

A **humidifier** to keep the humidity at the right level. Really helpful in winter or in dryer envionments.

An **elastic net** for helping to 'train' the plant once it reaches a certain size.

**Plant wire** for training the plant.

**Zip Ties or velcro** to keep things tidy on install

**Garden scissors** for trimming.

**Ph Meter or Ph Test drops** for science stuff.

## The Setup

Build the tent, hang the filter and blower all according to instructions. Zip ties are helpful here.

You'll need make sure that your tent has no light leaks. That includes any light sources aside from he primary light. Biggest example is surge protector.
