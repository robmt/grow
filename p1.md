# Germination

## Quick Start

### Option 1 - Tupperware and Paper Towel

#### Opt 1 Requirements

- Paper Towel
- Small sealed plastic container
- Slightly warm space

#### Opt 2 Process

Soak a paper towel in clean water until damp, not too wet. Fold paper towel in half with seed in the middle. Insert into sealed plastic container.

Place container in a warm space. Behind a desktop PC works well.

### Option 2 - Soil Plugs

#### Opt 2 Requirements

- Soil Plug
- Seed

#### Opt 2 Process

In order to use soil plugs for starters, soak them, then drop the seeds in. The soil plugs have all the nutrients and goodies the seeds and seedlings need until you transplant. With the right conditions (temp/humidity), they'll sprout.

## Details

Seed germination length: 3-10 days

The first marijuana plant stage begins with the seed. A cannabis seed should feel hard and dry, and be light- to dark-brown in color. An undeveloped seed is generally squishy and green or white in color and likely won’t germinate.

Once your seed has germinated, or sprouted, it’s ready to be placed in a growing medium, like soil. The tap root will drive down while the stem of the seedling will grow upward.

Two rounded cotyledon leaves will grow out from the stem as the plant unfolds from the protective casing of the seed. These initial leaves are responsible for taking in sunlight so the plant can grow healthy and stable.

As roots develop, the stalk will rise and you’ll begin to see the first iconic fan leaves grow, at which point your cannabis plant can be considered a seedling.
